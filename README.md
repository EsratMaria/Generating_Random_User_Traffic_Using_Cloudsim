# Generating Random User Traffic Using Cloudsim
In this repository, I generate random user traffic using cloudsim. The cloudlets are considered as traffic in this scenario. The cloudlets are randomly bound with the VMs.

The sample console output has been attached in the ```log.txt``` file.

### How to run

Import the file in the working directory of ```cloudsim/example``` and run as usual.
